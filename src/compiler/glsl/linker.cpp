/**
 * \file linker.cpp
 * GLSL linker implementation
 *
 * Given a set of shaders that are to be linked to generate a final program,
 * there are three distinct stages.
 *
 * In the first stage shaders are partitioned into groups based on the shader
 * type.  All shaders of a particular type (e.g., vertex shaders) are linked
 * together.
 *
 *   - Undefined references in each shader are resolve to definitions in
 *     another shader.
 *   - Types and qualifiers of uniforms, outputs, and global variables defined
 *     in multiple shaders with the same name are verified to be the same.
 *   - Initializers for uniforms and global variables defined
 *     in multiple shaders with the same name are verified to be the same.
 *
 * The result, in the terminology of the GLSL spec, is a set of shader
 * executables for each processing unit.
 *
 * After the first stage is complete, a series of semantic checks are performed
 * on each of the shader executables.
 *
 *   - Each shader executable must define a \c main function.
 *   - Each vertex shader executable must write to \c gl_Position.
 *   - Each fragment shader executable must write to either \c gl_FragData or
 *     \c gl_FragColor.
 *
 * In the final stage individual shader executables are linked to create a
 * complete exectuable.
 *
 *   - Types of uniforms defined in multiple shader stages with the same name
 *     are verified to be the same.
 *   - Initializers for uniforms defined in multiple shader stages with the
 *     same name are verified to be the same.
 *   - Types and qualifiers of outputs defined in one stage are verified to
 *     be the same as the types and qualifiers of inputs defined with the same
 *     name in a later stage.
