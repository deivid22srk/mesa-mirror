# Note that KHR-GL3* test sets include all tests from the previous
# version, so we only need to run one test list (unlike dEQP-GLES,
# where the test sets are separate).
# CTS enables GPU reset detection by default, which requires
# KHR_robustness support.
# Since this extension isn't implemented, disable it using
# "--deqp-terminate-on-device-lost=disable".
